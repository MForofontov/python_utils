    Check if a given year is a leap year.

    A leap year is divisible by 4, except for years divisible by 100,

    Parameters
    ----------
    year : int
        The year to check.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If year is not an integer.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> is_leap_year(2020)
    True
    >>> is_leap_year(1900)
    False
    >>> is_leap_year(2000)
