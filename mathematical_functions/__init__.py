"""
Mathematical functions package.

This package provides comprehensive mathematical, statistical, and advanced computational
functions organized into logical submodules. Each function supports multiple methods
and algorithms where applicable.

Submodules:
    basic: Basic mathematical operations with multiple algorithms
    advanced: Advanced mathematical computations and algorithms
    statistics: Statistical functions with various methods
    random: Random number generation and sampling functions
