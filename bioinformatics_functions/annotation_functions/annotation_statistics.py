    """
    Compute statistics from annotation records (counts, coverage, etc.).

    Parameters
    ----------
    annotations : Sequence[Dict[str, Any]]
        List of annotation records.

    Returns
    -------
    Dict[str, Any]
        Dictionary of statistics (feature counts, total coverage, etc.).

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If input types are incorrect.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> annots = [{'feature': 'exon', 'start': 10, 'end': 20}, ...]
    >>> annotation_statistics(annots)
    {'feature_counts': {'exon': 1}, 'total_coverage': 10}

    Notes
    -----
    Computes feature counts and total coverage.

    Complexity
    ----------
    Time: O(n), Space: O(k) where k is number of unique features
