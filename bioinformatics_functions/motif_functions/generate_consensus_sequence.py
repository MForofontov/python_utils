def generate_consensus_sequence(sequences: list[str], threshold: float = 0.5) -> str:
    """
    Generate a consensus sequence from multiple aligned sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequences : list[str]
        List of aligned sequences (must all be same length).
    threshold : float, optional
        Minimum fraction of sequences that must have a base for it to be
        included in consensus (by default 0.5). Otherwise 'N' is used.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Consensus sequence.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If sequences is not a list.
        If threshold is not a float or int.
    ValueError
        If sequences list is empty.
        If sequences have different lengths.
        If threshold is not between 0 and 1.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> generate_consensus_sequence(["ATGC", "ATGC", "ATGC"])
    'ATGC'
    >>> generate_consensus_sequence(["ATGC", "ATCC", "ATAC"])
    'ATGC'
    >>> generate_consensus_sequence(["ATGC", "TTGC", "CTGC", "GTGC"])
    'NTGC'
    >>> generate_consensus_sequence(["AT-C", "ATGC", "ATCC"], threshold=0.5)
    'ATGC'

    Notes
    -----
    For each position, the most common base is chosen.
    If no base reaches the threshold, 'N' is used.
    Gaps ('-') are treated as regular characters.
    Case-sensitive - returns uppercase consensus.
    
    Complexity
    ----------
    Time: O(n*m), Space: O(m) where n is number of sequences, m is sequence length
