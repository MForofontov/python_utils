    """
    Retry an asynchronous function on failure, using exponential backoff.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : Callable[..., Awaitable[T]]
        The asynchronous function to retry.
    retries : int
        The maximum number of retry attempts.
    initial_delay : float
        The initial delay in seconds before the first retry.
    backoff_factor : float
        The factor by which the delay is multiplied after each retry.

    Returns
    -------
    T
        The result of the function if successful.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        If the function fails after all retries.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> async def sometimes_fails() -> int:
    >>>     if random.random() < 0.5:
    >>>         raise ValueError("Random failure")
    >>>     return 42
